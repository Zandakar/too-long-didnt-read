I spent the last 5 days in a hotel-turned-esport-centre called RCADIA in Hamburg. On my second to last day there I met a pro rocket (currently my favourite game) league player (who saved me at the gym after I failed my bench press set, oops) and I fanboyed a little bit. I would have loved the opportunity to do something like that myself at his age.

One thing I've realised as I'm travelling more is that had I grown up in the Netherlands, this is something I would have surely done more often. In a way, I've always thought my life in Australia was better in every aspect, but there are definitely things I've missed out on. Not that I'd want it to be different, but it's interesting to think about how different I would be as a person had I grown up in Europe instead.

*Das Rathaus (State House), built after the great fire of 1842*  
*Buildings with green roofs survived WW2. Post war construction didn't use copper*

Took a walking tour through the Hamburg city centre (yes, it's where Hamburgers were invented) and learned a bit about its history. This was my first time doing a walking tour, and will definitely do it again for other cities. Like with all art, I think context is extremely important, and learning the significance of certain buildings and the major historical events of the city really adds to the experience of being a tourist.

I ended up walking around with a Greek Girl, Dimitri, who studied architecture and had some interesting insights. She put me on to an app called Workaway, through which she spent time living in a community, working for board. That sounds pretty cool to me, and might be something I pursue in the near future.

*Hamburgische Staatsoper (Hamburg State House). Initial estimation was 78M, final cost ~900M*

On my way to Berlin now, back to staying in hostels for a week or two. I've recently finished reading  [Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5056774584), which is one of the best books I've ever read. Next on the list is [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/629.Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=YPS3jWXi9h&rank=1) which is a little more light-hearted but a welcome change of pace.
