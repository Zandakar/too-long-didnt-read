Berlin is a pretty cool city. If you want to go out on a Wednesday night, you can do that. If you'd like to see some 800 year old buildings the next morning, you can do that too. The food here is on point, but they definitely have too many donner (kebab) places. There is a sense of freedom / openness, and I've never seen so many mohawks in my life.

On my walking tour through the town centre, the tour guide mentioned that the government is still extremely paper based. As part of the process to apply for his citizenship, he sent them an email, to which they sent a physical letter with a URL he had to follow. They hyperlinked a paper letter. Some things are extremely efficient, some things are extremely not.

He also noted that while a lot of people come to Berlin to see and learn about the time of the Nazis, this was only a ~12 year period, and it would be a shame to discard the rest. Germany has always valued the arts and science - for example, lots of famous composers from the last 500 years or so were German, and the university of Freiburg alone has 19 Nobel prize winners (compared to Australia's 16)

Regardless, I do still find the war stuff pretty interesting. I really respect Germany's stance on it - They own up to what happened (Unlike some others, looking at you Japan and USA) and educate kids from year 5 onwards about the events. You can tell that they try their best to have a healthy relationship with their past.

I find that I'm having to introduce myself a lot. Existential crises aside (WHO AM I???) I've found that it's a good way to think about and refine how I present myself. Constantly having people go in and out of your life does make you adverse to making new friendships at times though. It takes effort to get to know someone, and just as you get comfortable you have to do it all again. I've found this to be the hardest thing about travelling this way so far.

I'll be spending a few more days in Berlin and then heading off to Prague. I'm now half way through the European part of my trip and I've only done 2 countries, and so my current plan is that I'm going to make an effort to get some more flags under my belt. I'll probably go straight to Asia after and try find some longer term accommodation. Till next time, Tsch√ºss
