What to talk about:
- Getting sick again
- Rotterdam / den haag
- Cycling with friends
- Dusseldorf (game house)
- Making music
- Packing list?

So I ended up getting food poisoning a few days after recovering from covid. In a way it was actually worse, I was completely bedridden for about a day or two. Not having much luck haha, hopefully I can actually go out and do travel things again soon. The first reddit post I saw one of those bedridden mornings was "I just got over shingles, covid, and cancer this year!". Put things into perspective.

The last week or so I've stayed in Rotterdam and Den Haag (approx. 30 mins by public transport from another). Both have a very student-town vibe, especially Den Haag. What struck me the most was the architecture - both cities display some very unique buildings. Some look odd, but by and large they are pieces of art.

The hostel I stayed at (KingKool - would recommend. Wish I took more pictures) provided free board in exchange for 20 hrs of work per week which is something that sounds pretty cool to do for a while.

The few days I had in between being sick were spent with a younger couple, Alex and Yoanna. Both are currently living in Berlin and were on their final leg of a Euro trip. In true Dutch fashion we rented some bikes and hit the streets of Arnhem, cycling to a couple castles. Looking forward to meeting up with them again in Berlin.

I'm currently writing this in DÃ¼sseldorf, Duitsland, awaiting my train to go to Hamburg where I'll stay at a eSports themed gaming house. Hope to meet some fellow nerds and ruin some kids' days.

I'm working on providing some way for me to ping people when I make a new blog post. I'm aiming for about one per week released ~Friday, but it'll be a nice little challenge. I'm also slowly upping my daily commitments - I'm going to spend 30 mins daily this next month on music production, really focusing on learning how to use my keyboard and Ableton before anything else. Lastly, I'll be doing a packing list and adding a resource section to the blog for any useful apps and tips.

Here's this weeks photo dump. Take care.
