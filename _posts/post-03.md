So I ended up getting food poisoning a few days after recovering from covid. In a way it was actually worse, I was completely bedridden for about a day or two. The first reddit post I saw one of those bedridden mornings was "I recovered from shingles, covid, and cancer this year!". Put things into perspective. Regardless, I hope to be at full speed again soon.

The last week or so I've stayed in Rotterdam and Den Haag (approx. 30 mins by public transport from another). Both have a very student-town vibe, especially Den Haag. What struck me the most was the architecture - both cities display some very unique buildings. Some look odd, but by and large they are pieces of art. The cities have a friendly rivalry with each other, similar to we do with NZ.

The hostel I stayed at (KingKool - would recommend. Wish I took more pictures) provided free board in exchange for 20 hrs of work per week which is something that sounds pretty cool to do for a while. They even had a collab with a local brewery for their own beer!

The few days I had in between being sick were spent with a younger couple, Alex and Yoanna. Both are currently living in Berlin and were on their final leg of a Euro trip. In true Dutch fashion we rented some bikes and hit the streets of Arnhem, cycling to a couple castles. Looking forward to meeting up with them again in Berlin.

I'm currently writing this in DÃ¼sseldorf, Duitsland, awaiting my train to go to Hamburg where I'll stay at a eSports themed gaming house. Hope to meet some fellow nerds and ruin some kids' days. I really enjoyed my time in the Netherlands and will definitely be back again some day. I'm really not Dutch anymore, however it will always be a part of my identity and have a special place in my heart.

I'm working on providing some way for me to ping people when I make a new blog post. While I'm aiming to release these posts on a schedule (one per week released ~Friday) it'll be a nice little challenge. I'm also slowly upping my daily commitments - I'm going to spend 30 mins daily this next month on music production, really focusing on learning how to use my keyboard and Ableton before anything else. Lastly, I'll be doing a packing list and adding a resource section to the blog for any useful apps and tips.

Here's this weeks photo dump. Take care.
