Hey guys, long time. I'm finally starting to hit a few milestones - This is my 10'th blog post, and I've almost finished a tube of toothpaste on this trip. I'm still in Hungary until the end of this week so I haven't been doing an awful lot of sight-seeing. I still wanted to write and figured I would do it about meditation.

So why even bother to mediate? My first exposure to it was through my favourite podcast, the [Tim Ferris Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/), who interviews a variety of people who excel in their field (Chess grandmasters, the CEO of disney, Hugh Jackman and the likes). Meditation was something that came up frequently, and figured if these high performers find it worth their time, there must be something good about it.

Teaches you to focus
Focus is the supreme skill
Time between action and reaction
Allows you to change the course of your day


Meditation really is the gym for your brain. We all understand the importance of being physically healthy, but these days most of the work we do is mental. Focus is the supreme skill, it doesn't matter if you're playing guitar, writing software, or a football player. Meditation trains this by setting time aside to force your brain to focus on only one particular thing.
