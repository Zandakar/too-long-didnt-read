Seoul is the most modern city I've ever been to. The infrastructure is exceptionally good - not once did my 4G drop out (even in the metro), trains are extremely regular and the streets are as clean as they could be, especially considering the lack of bins. The food is on-point (although it can sometimes be a bit weird, like fermented crab), and the effort spent on fashion for both men and women is instantly noticeable.

My first impression of Seoul (pronounced "soul", I got this wrong for way too long) was that that it was rather sterile. While there is some interesting architecture, many buildings are plain grey and there is a distinct lack of greenery, and everyone wears masks even outside. I thought that it was purely to keep viruses at bay, but there is another invisible reason - once you gain some distance from the city, you can notice the amount of air pollution - apparently much of it can be traced back to China.

It's really interesting to see the mix of cutting-edge technology and remnants of old culture. Seoul has multiple palaces, a hanok village (where all the homes are built to replicate the style of 600 years ago) and many Buddhist temples. Korea has a long history of foreign occupation by its surrounding nations and particularly Japan, who destroyed (but also rebuilt) many of the original ancient buildings.

I've really enjoyed eating a bunch of Korean food. They love "banchan", many little side dishes before the main meal, mainly consisting of pickled radish, kimchi, bean sprouts and more. As for the main course, you can everything from more traditional food in night markets (like raw beef pate and japchae, glass noodles) to fried chicken and beer, and of course my favourite Korean BBQ.

There are still 10 million families separated by the Demilitarized zone (DMZ) established by the UN in 1953, a barrier between the two nations. South Koreans are forbidden to travel to the North, but can take a tour of the DMZ like tourists, where you can see one of the multiple caves the North dug underneath the border to try and infiltrate the south.

*This is North Korea. On a good day you can see the propaganda village in the distance. Both sides used to blast propaganda over loudspeakers to each other until they agreed to stop in 2018*

When the north was first established, it was actually richer than the south. It's crazy to see how much of an influence a government can have on a nation. It's a shame that the first time the country got a shot at true independence it was torn apart  again by bigger nations, this time through a proxy war. Despite this, the south remains hopeful that one day they'll get to see a unified Korea.

I've finally finished reading [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5196527951) which was a difficult read, and then blasted through [amoralman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53168892-amoralman), the story of how a magician became a card cheat poker dealer. I've been trying to read more, and it's something I want to continue doing back in the real world. I'm currently writing this from Taiwan where I'll spend the next 2 weeks or so, and then fly out to Vietnam, from where I'll return back home. Annyeong!~~~
