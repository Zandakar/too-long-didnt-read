Vienna (locally, Wien) is a really beautiful city. It's what I was expecting west Germany to be like. Austria and Germany have a friendly rivalry similar to Australians and New Zealand, albeit slightly more like siblings constantly trying to one-up each other. To their credit, they've been voted the most liveable city 10 years in a row by the Economist Intelligence Unit.

I stayed at the "Jo & Joe" hostel right in the city centre, literally built on-top of an Ikea. An interesting quirky boutique hostel that I'd highly recommend. Not too crazy, but highly social and practical.

Like most of the countries around here it has plenty of colourful WW2 history. Hitler was welcomed with relatively open, giving his speech about freeing the Germans of Austria on the podium pictured below. Due to the symbolism, it hasn't been re-used since, and a make-shift podium is set up instead.

One of the things that really struck me about Vienna is the quality of the tap water, it's literally the best water I've tasted. Apparently they pipe it straight from the alps, which are about 100KM away. The second thing that impressed me was the quantity of vast buildings. Much of it was build relatively recently (~150 years), and the architecture is a mix and match of styles. Some of it is simply truly old. I wish I got more pictures to share.

The next city I visited was Bratislava in Slovakia. A much smaller and quieter city, but I stayed at a party hostel called Urban Elephants (which has a crazier sister, Wild Elephants). Bare basics infrastructure, bar crawls and house parties literally every night. People nudie running down the hallways. Definitely a change of pace, but good fun for a bit.

On the bus to Bratislava (I cannot recommend Flixbus enough) we drove past the biggest windfarms I've ever seen. Each windmill produces enough power for ~9500 homes on average. I don't know why people say that they're ugly (I wouldn't be surprised if the fossil fuel industry has something to do with this), to me they look futuristic and symbolise the kind of future we should strive for.

Slovakia, previously part of Czechoslovakia, has had a difficult history. Their default state has been occupation, finally becoming an independent state for the first time after accepting Hitler's deal: Join the Axis powers or be invaded. Doing so meant betraying their Czech friends to the north, however as fate would have it, they would later resist the Nazis and be occupied regardless.

After the war ended, they were "Freed" (under new management) by the Soviets, and as such they were under communist rule between 1948–1989. Private entrepreneurship and speaking up against the government were highly illegal, punishable by death, or for the truly unlucky a trip to the gulags or uranium mines for you and your family. The city is filled with soviet architecture and relics.

Winter is coming. Golden hour is at 3:30 and the sun is fully down within the hour. I've been relatively lucky with the weather until now, however the last week or 2 have been rather grey. At least when it rains here in Europe it's no more than a drizzle compared to the downpour we get in Perth. Vitamin D tablets are now a staple of my diet, and I'm trying to make the most of the few hours of sunlight I get, especially since my average wake-up time is around 11:30.

I'm currently trying to fix some issues I've been having with the blog behind the scenes and my next post should be a little sooner than this one. Hopefully I'll have my email notifications done by then too. I've also finally finished my first song, but it takes about a month to publish it to Spotify, so I'll include a link when it's done.

I'm writing this from Budapest, Hungary, and taking a few days off before actively being a tourist again. I've bought my visa for Turkey and so I'll head in that direction soon enough, but for now I'm very content doing the bare minimum for a little while. 
Na jó, szia.
