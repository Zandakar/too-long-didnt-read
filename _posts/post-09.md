Hello again. I've finally added a mailing list, if you want to receive an email whenever I do a post click [here](https://too-long-didnt-read.au/mailing-list/index.html).

I'm currently in Budapest, Hungary, in a hostel called Shantee house. I was supposed to stay for 5 days, but it's a running gag within the hostel that everyone extends, and I am no exception. I've extended for 2 weeks already and will probably stay for a month. Being here is exactly what I was looking for when I left on my trip - a place with good people, to kick back and do the work I want to do.

Budapest was originally comprised of 2 separate cities, Buda (meaning water) and Pest (oven or stove). The two sides of the city are split by the Danube, a 2,850 km long river which starts in Germany and terminates in Romania.

Hungary was ruled by the Habsburgs of Austria between 1526 and 1867. During this time, Hungary attempted 2 uprisings, and even though they failed, the Austrians were sick of having to deal with the constant resistance. In order to satisfy the Hungarians, the Austria-Hungary empire was born, which planned to make Budapest the second capital of the empire. Because of this, the city boasts multiple castles and vast government buildings beyond what a nation of this wealth and population could usually afford.
