Hello again. I've finally added a mailing list, if you want to receive an email whenever I do a post click [here](https://too-long-didnt-read.au/mailing-list/index.html).

I'm currently in Budapest, Hungary, in a hostel called Shantee house. I was supposed to stay for 5 days, but it's a running gag within the hostel that everyone extends, and I am no exception. I've extended for 2 weeks already and will probably stay for a month. Being here is exactly what I was looking for when I left on my trip - a place with good people, to kick back and do the work I want to do.

Budapest was originally comprised of 2 separate cities, Buda (meaning water) and Pest (oven or stove). The two sides of the city are split by the Danube, a 2,850 km long river which starts in Germany and terminates in Romania.

Hungary was ruled by the Habsburgs of Austria between 1526 and 1867. During this time, Hungary attempted 2 uprisings, and even though they failed, the Austrians were sick of having to deal with the constant resistance.
\
\
In order to satisfy the Hungarians, the Austria-Hungary empire was born, which planned to make Budapest the second capital of the empire. Because of this, the city boasts multiple castles and vast government buildings beyond what a nation of this wealth and population could usually afford.

Hungary was extremely complicit during WW2. Within 2 months, 440,000 Jews were deported or murdered. Many were tried together and pushed into the river Danube.
\
\
 Travelling through Europe and listening to how WW2 played out in all the cities I visited you see a common theme - Hitler didn't convince millions of people to die for him, there was already a strong anti-Semitic sentiment throughout Europe, and he was simply able to capitalise on that.

That'll be the last I write about WW2 for a while. It's been really interesting hearing about how each country I visited was formed and became the nation it is today, and it makes you remember that compared to the not-so-distant-past we live in relatively peaceful times.

My days are rather simple right now. My only responsibilities are my own, and my only real worry is how I'm going to spend my day. I'm bored, but in a good way, the kind of boredom that makes you observe and reflect. I feel different than I did 3 months ago, but also know how easy it is to fall back into old habits and mannerisms.

\
\
The biggest factor whether I enjoy a city or not has been the people I'm with at the time. Most of the tourist attractions are the same regardless of the city - castles, churches, and to an extent culture, since once you go to countries with low English literacy you can only enjoy it at a surface level.

 Certain hostels attract a certain kind of person, and so I urge anyone that wants to travel to be extra mindful when booking their accommodation. Of course this has a learning curve too and some places will suit you better than others, but those 10 or 15 minutes you spend looking for your next accommodation can dictate how you spend the next days or weeks.
\
\
Soon my visa will expire and I'll have to leave Europe. Because I stayed in Budapest for longer than anticipated I'll only get to see Istanbul before leaving to Asia, but I guess that gives me good reason to come back.

 I've been spending 30 minutes a day doing creative work, and my goal is to make a song that gets played on triple J at least once. I'd like to try to make a video game too, and I'll start learning how to do that soon. Still reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, but it's a big book and I've been putting it off for a bit. Until next time, Ciao.
