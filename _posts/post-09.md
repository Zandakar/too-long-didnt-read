Hello again. I've finally added a mailing list, if you want to receive an email whenever I do a post click [here](https://too-long-didnt-read.au/mailing-list/index.html).

I'm currently in Budapest, Hungary, in a hostel called Shantee house. I was supposed to stay for 5 days, but it's a running gag within the hostel that everyone extends, and I am no exception. I've extended for 2 weeks already and will probably stay for a month. Being here is exactly what I was looking for when I left on my trip - a place with good people, to kick back and do the work I want to do.

Budapest was originally comprised of 2 separate cities, Buda (meaning water) and Pest (oven or stove). The two sides of the city are split by the Danube, a 2,850 km long river which starts in Germany and terminates in Romania.

Hungary was ruled by the Habsburgs of Austria between 1526 and 1867. During this time, Hungary attempted 2 uprisings, and even though they failed, the Austrians were sick of having to deal with the constant resistance. In order to satisfy the Hungarians, the Austria-Hungary empire was born, which planned to make Budapest the second capital of the empire. Because of this, the city boasts multiple castles and vast government buildings beyond what a nation of this wealth and population could usually afford.

Hungary was extremely complicit during WW2. Within 2 months, 440,000 Jews were deported or murdered. Many were tried together and pushed into the river Danube. Travelling through Europe and listening to how WW2 played out in all the cities I visited you see a common theme - Hitler didn't convince millions of people to die for him, there was already a strong anti-simitic sentiment throughout Europe, and he was simply able to capitalise on that.

That'll probably be the last I write about WW2 for a while though. It's been really interesting hearing about how each country I visited was formed and became the nation it is today, and it makes you realise that compared to the past we live in very peaceful times.

I'll probably stay here in Budapest until the 15th or so which is when my 90 day visa will expire. Sadly I won't get to do Italy, Switzerland, Spain and Portugal, but that also leaves something for next time. My next destination will likely be South Korea or Taiwan to start the S.E. Asia leg of my trip, something that I'm really looking forward to.
