So I've been on the road now for just over 3 months (a season if you will), and figured I would write about the experience of backpacking as a whole so far.

The first thing that really surprized me is the amount of time travelling takes up. Even if I'm not going from place to place, simple tasks take much longer. Before I set out, I imagined I would have all this free time to work on passion projects, and while I have much more time now, somehow it still feels like there isn't enough time in the day.

The upside from this is that it forces you to slow down. That, and simply being removed from the daily grind means that I've had a lot of time to think about my life and what I want to do in the future. You also realise that the things you miss from back home are what are truly important.

The lifestyle is pretty sustainable for long periods of time. Living out of your backpack becomes second nature - I truly feel like I have everything I need on me. It can also be done cheaper than I originally thought, although it really helps to have enough money to get a private room when you feel like you need one.

It feels like I've had a year's worth of life experience crammed into the last few months. The best thing about it is the amount of people you meet - you end up having some pretty interesting conversations and doing things on a whim that you didn't imagine when you woke up that morning. As far as age demographics, most people are between 21 and 25, some between 25 and 32, and you get the occasional old timer.

I would recommend this kind of a trip to anyone that feels unsure about the direction of their life or themselves. While the experience doesn't solve all problems, it does offer a different perspective on what's important by taking a step back from everything and simply enjoying other cultures and people for a while. If anything, backpacking helps you understand that it's OK not to have all the answers all the time, but when you feel this way, it just means that you need to think of the right questions.
