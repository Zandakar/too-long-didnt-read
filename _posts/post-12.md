So I've been on the road now for just over 3 months (a season if you will), and figured I would write about the experience of backpacking as a whole so far.
\
\
The first thing that really surprized me is the amount of time travelling takes up. Even if I'm not going from place to place, simple tasks take much longer. Before I set out, I imagined I would have all this free time to work on passion projects, and while I have much more time now, somehow it still feels like there isn't enough time in the day.
\
\
The upside from this is that it forces you to slow down. That, and simply being removed from the daily grind means that I've had a lot of time to think about my life and what I want to do in the future. You also realise that the things you miss from back home are what are truly important. 
\
\
You get used to carrying less stuff. I've had a few comments made by people that I pack pretty light, but after a while it doesn't feel that way. The only thing I'm missing gear-wise is a second pair of shoes, and I might see if I can find a way to make that work now that I'm in snow territory.
\
\
People are sick everywhere, all the time. Because you're in such close contact with so many different people, the moment your immune system drops you'll feel it. It's important to try and look after your health.
\
\


It sounds cliche, but the people you meet are really what make it great. 



All the touristy 
You get pretty burned out of being a tourist after a while, it's something that's come up often in conversation with other backpackers.
