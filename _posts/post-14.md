My initial impression was that Taipei, being a big city, would be vibrant during Chinese new year, and oh boy was I wrong. Turns out that most people go to the countryside to visit their family, and word on the street was that the city would turn into a relative ghost town. Lucky for me that relative to Perth, Taipei was still very much alive, albeit operating at ~40%-75% for the week that I was there.

While Taiwan isn't as clean and orderly as Korea or Japan, it makes up for it in character. The abundance of greenery was a welcome change from Seoul's concrete jungle, and by no means did the country lack in regards to infrastructure - traversing public transportation and obtaining a cheap sim card were simple enough tasks.

One of the biggest attractions are the night markets. You can usually find one within a few kilometres of your accommodation, although a handful are well known for certain specialties. The main attraction is food (I've seen lines that'd put Sizzler to shame),but stalls vending cheap clothes and arcade style children's games are mixed throughout. Most of the food leans towards the unhealthy but delicious side of the spectrum (as a local put it, "people go there to have fun").
