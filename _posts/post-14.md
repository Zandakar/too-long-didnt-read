My initial impression was that Taipei, being a big city, would be vibrant during Chinese new year, and oh boy was I wrong. Turns out that most people go to the countryside to visit their family, and word on the street was that the city would turn into a relative ghost town. Lucky for me that relative to Perth, Taipei was still very much alive, albeit operating at ~40%-75% for the week that I was there.

While Taiwan isn't as clean and orderly as Korea or Japan, it makes up for it in character. The abundance of greenery was a welcome change from Seoul's concrete jungle, and by no means did the country lack in regards to infrastructure - traversing public transportation and obtaining a cheap sim card were simple enough tasks.

One of the biggest attractions are the night markets. You can usually find one within a few kilometres of your accommodation, although a handful are well known for certain specialties. The main attraction is food (I've seen lines that'd put Sizzler to shame), but stalls vending cheap clothes and arcade style children's games are mixed throughout. Most of the food leans towards the unhealthy but delicious side of the spectrum (as a local put it, "people go there to have fun").

Taiwan is a great way to get a taste of (what felt to me like) authentic Chinese culture. The word "China" wasn't the elephant in the room that I thought it would be - The Taiwanese call their language Chinese, they celebrate Chinese new year, and it's in the official name of the country. While the growing tensions with the mainland is certainly something in the back of their minds, I  encountered no media related to it during my stay there.

About a hour and a half by train is Taichung, the small island's second biggest city, which boasts some beautiful scenery. A few hours by bus will take you to Sun Moon lake, a popular casual cycling location and famous for its sunrise. I also had the pleasure to be invited to the coolest restaurant I've ever been to called "Stars Moon Sky" Apparently the Chinese language has a word for "restaurant with a good view" which I thought was cool. They turned a ~2 acre block of land into a adult playground with great attention to detail and even greater views.

I'm writing this from Vietnam, which will be my last destination before I head back home for a while. Guess we'll see how I feel when I get back, but that's how I feel now. Even if I end my trip here, I would love to do something like this again in the future (within 3 years), walk the Camino de Santiago, or spend 6 months at home in "retirement". But I guess I shouldn't really be thinking about my next trip just yet. See you all soon.
