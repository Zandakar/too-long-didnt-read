The week before I left was one of the craziest weeks of my life. Lots to do. So much stuff! I'm running a Ospray 55L backpack (which I highly recommend), but it's still a very limited amount of space.
\
\
I found the subreddits /r/onebag and /r/solotravel to be pretty useful for ideas of what and what not to bring. Packing / compression cubes are a must. The substance of my bag will certainly change as I journey to different climates.

\
We (My dad, sister and I) spent the first week at a castle one of my dad's friends manages. Shout-out to Michiel for the great accommodation.

Most of this week was spent fighting jetlag and seeing family. I've missed hanging out with family and it's been great to do that again. Holland feels both foreign and familiar to me. It's weird, but it's nice.
\
\
I ended up playing futsal in the Netherlands, something I've always wanted to do. End result 9-8 to us, with me scoring 4 (and the final) goal. I'm really happy that I've gotten good enough to do well in the football-happy nation.

The second week is the first time I've been by my self. I've met some cool people (ranging from a local crackhead to backpackers from rural QLD).
\
\
I checked out the Rijksmuseum and some other interesting art exhibits. Other than that, just a lot of walking. Amsterdam is a extremely diverse and vibrant city that I might decide to come back to. I'll be here till Mondee and then head to Rotterdam.

Finally, I've really been enjoying my free time. Amsterdam is relatively expensive and so I've been trying to make the most of of it, but I'm looking forward to having some more free time and working on some passion projects.
\
\
Until next time
