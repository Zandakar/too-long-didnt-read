My general philosophy on packing clothing is that I want to do a wash cycle around every 5 days. Packing for winter weather is difficult, since a lot of space is taken up by jackets etc.

I would recommend that you bring only things you actually NEED, and that you buy things as they come up. It's better to have too little than too much, since excess gear will need to be disposed of one way or another.

Clothes:
- Latex travel pillow. 100% worth bringing this, compresses nicely in compression cubes, and having a consistently good pillow is a game changer.
- Sport shorts 1x. Going to get a second pair.
- Shorts 1x
- Jeans 2x
- Trackies 1x
- Hoodie 1x. Dropping this for a more compact alternative
- Utility Jacket 1x. Heavy, but extremely versatile. 
- Beany
- Leather belt. Would maybe bring a cloth belt next time to save space, however I'm almost always wearing this.
- Darn Tough Socks 6x. (3x sport, 3x hiking). Great quality and would highly recommend these socks to anyone. Sport socks are a bit tight for their size, but the hiking socks are game changers.
- Meriwool Underwear 5x. Similar to the socks, 100% recommend these, especially since they stop jeans from chafing and I'm doing a lot of walking.
- Spare undies 2x. Good for laundry day.
- Shirts 4x
- Undershirts 3x. Might pick up extras
- Underarmour dain jacket. Would probably pick up something more generic on the way next time.

Bag: Ospray farpoint 55L (M/L). Comes as 2 bags, a ~40L backpack and 15L daybag. The daybag is a pain in the ass to attach when both bags are full, bu other than that I can't fault the bag and would recommend to others. Note that it comes in 2 sizes, and they vary greatly in where the supports are, so go to a physical store to get sized up before purchasing.
