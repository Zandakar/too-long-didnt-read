My general philosophy on packing clothing is that I want to do a wash cycle around every 5 days. Your washing cycles will be based on what runs out first, so don't pack 6 shirts and 1 pair of socks. Packing for winter weather is more difficult, since a lot of space is taken up by warm weather clothes.
\
\
I would recommend that you bring only things you actually NEED, and that you buy things as they come up. It's better to have too little than too much, since excess gear will need to be disposed of one way or another.

\
***-- Clothes --***
\
**Sport shorts**
- Going to get a second pair
\
**Trackies**
\
**Hoodie**
- Dropping this for a more compact alternative
\
**Utility Jacket**
- Takes up a bit of space, but extremely versatile.
\
**Beany**
\
**Leather belt**
\
**Darn Tough Socks 6x (3x sport, 3x hiking)**
- Great quality and would highly recommend these socks to anyone. Sport socks are a bit tight for their size, but the hiking socks are game changers.
\
**Meriwool Underwear 5x**
- Don't bring too few undies, can really mess with your washing cycle. Similar to the socks, 100% recommend these, especially since they stop jeans from chafing and I'm doing a lot of walking.
\
**Spare undies 2x** 
- Good to have for laundry day.
\
**Shirts 4x**
\
**Undershirts 3x**
- Might pick up extras, good to sleep in + extra layer when it's cold out
\
**Under Armour rain jacket** 
- Would probably pick up something more generic on the way next time.
\
\
***-- Other Gear --***
\
**Latex travel pillow**
- 100% worth bringing this. Having a consistently good pillow is a game changer. You spend 1/3 of your time on this. Try a few before you leave.
\
**Misc meds**
- Get some, you'll need them. Use google to find a travel doctor, a standard GP will turn you away. Give your self at least a month to get all vaccines
\
**Packing cubes 3x**
- Great for organising your gear, and quickly packing / unpacking. 100% recommend
\
**Compression cubes 2x**
- Like packing cubes except with extra zips that compress it. Perfect if you bring a travel pillow
\
**Tote bag**
- For dirty laundry 
\
**Novation mk3 mini MIDI keyboard**
- Great entry level MIDI controller, especially if you use ableton.
\
**Kindle**
- For any readers out there that haven't tried using one, give the kindle a week. I promise you that you don't like the physical feeling of books as much as you think you do, and the ability to carry 30+ books (and get more whenever you want) is a game changer. You can also pirate books, but you wouldn't do that, would you?
\
**Travel towel**
- Bring one. Admittedly not as good as a normal towel, but not all places provide them for you.
\
**Sleep mask**
- Invest in a good one since you'll be using it a LOT.
\
**Ear plugs**
- Same as above. I'm a side sleeper and brought "loops" from amazon - they work well but hurt after a while. I still carry some foam ones with me for this reason
\
**Fork**
\
**Portable battery**
\
**Earphones**
\
**Xbox controller**
\
**Laptop**
\
**Logitech G9 gaming mouse**
- Great mouse
\
**Bag protector**
\
**Sunnies**
\
**Earfun free pro 2 wireless earbuds**
- Entry level wireless earphones. ~$100, you get what you pay for, but is great bang for buck. Good quality sound, noise cancelling is mediocre.
\
**Toiletry bag**
\
**Pilot pens**
\
**Passport holder**
\
**1L drink bottle**
- Could easily get away with 750ml
**Padlocks (in next photo) 2x**
- Get a thick and a thin padlock (wire preferred). Different hostels have different locks, one size doesn't fit all.

Bag: Ospray farpoint 55L (M/L). Comes as 2 bags, a ~40L backpack and 15L daybag. The daybag is a pain in the ass to attach when both bags are full, but other than that I can't fault the bag and would recommend to others. Note that it comes in 2 sizes, and they vary greatly in where the supports are, so go to a physical store to get sized up before purchasing.
