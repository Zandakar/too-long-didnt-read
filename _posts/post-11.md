Istanbul is exactly the kind of place that I imagined wanting to visit when I first set out. Culturally it's extremely different, very much middle eastern and and very much Muslim. The food is good (and cheap, as long as you stay away from the tourist areas) and it's nice to finally get to see some sunlight again.

One of the first thing you notice is the amount of stray cats everywhere, and I mean everywhere. In the subway, in the restaurants, and especially out in the streets. Aptly nicknamed the city of cats, they were first introduced in the (at the time) wooden city in order to combat rats, but these days they are a part of Turkish culture.

\
\
The government runs a program that waters, feeds and immunises the cats (and dogs). This, mixed with the people's adoration for them, means that the average stray cat looks extremely healthy and very comfortable around humans.

The second thing that stood out to me was the daily call to prayers. Muslims pray 5 times a day starting at sunrise. When it's time to pray, it's clearly announced from the rooftops of the many mosques around the city over loudspeaker. 
\
\

\
\
Since it's forbidden to show the faces of religious prophets, mosques put emphasis on colours and geometric shapes. Blue is often used (so much that when the visited Turkey, they named blue "turquoise" - colour of the Turks)

The food in here is extremely good quality. You can get...

There is a darker side to Turkey, however. While officially a Democracy
