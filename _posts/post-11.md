I've officially been on the road for 3 months now - a season if you will - and want to write about my experience so far.

Travelling through Europe is a relatively painless experience.

Experience in hostels varies widely. Some People are really weird.

Covid (in hostels)

You don't need as much money as you think

Feels like a year of experience crammed into 3 months

Less value on my work, but more of a drive
