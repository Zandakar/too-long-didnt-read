Istanbul is exactly the kind of place that I wanted to visit when I set out. Culturally it's extremely different from Europe and much of the western world, from the middle-eastern aesthetics to the food and religious practices.

One of the first thing you notice is the amount of stray cats everywhere, and I mean everywhere. In the subway, in the restaurants, and especially out in the streets. Aptly nicknamed the city of cats, they were originally introduced to keep the rats away from the wooden homes, but have since become a part of everyday Turkish life.

The government runs a program that waters, feeds and immunises the cats (and dogs). This, mixed with the people's adoration for them, means that the average stray looks extremely healthy and is very comfortable around people.

Another thing that stands out are the daily calls to prayers. Muslims pray 5 times a day starting at sunrise, and when it's time to pray it's clearly announced from the rooftops of the many mosques around the city over loudspeaker by the muezzins (Islamic officials) though song. Admittedly, 5 am is a bit earlier than I'd like.

\
Since it's forbidden to show the faces of religious prophets, mosques put emphasis on colours, shapes, and text. Blue is often used, so much so that when the French visited Turkey they named it "turquoise" - colour of the Turks.

The food in here is extremely good quality, and cheap as long as you stay out of the tourist areas. An average dinner will set you back 80-100 Turkish Lira, or $8, and I've had good breakfasts for half that. Turkish coffee is interesting - the grounds are mixed with the water instead of filtered, creating a thicker coffee. You're supposed to agitate the cup often, else you are left with a thick sludge at the bottom.

The cheap food is a result of a collapsing economy - 10 years ago the Lira was more than 1 to 1 with the Australian dollar, now the conversion rate is 1 to 12, with the majority of the damage happening this year. Turkey is a 2nd world country, at at times it shows - I've seen unwashed children on the street collecting rubbish for money.

There is also a darker side to Turkey. Police stand around with submachine guns, shopping malls and subway stations are equipped with metal detectors. Before every major election, there is an increase in terrorist attacks, and this time is no exception with the recent bombing in Istanbul. The internet is also filtered, with "family-friendly" restrictions in place filtering anything that goes against Islamic morals or the government's image.

Regardless of these things, I've never felt unsafe in the city, and it's been one of my favourite visits so far and would highly recommend it.

I've finally made a song and published it to spotify which was a goal of mine. I'm not sure how many of you like techno music, but if you'd like to listen, [here it is](https://open.spotify.com/track/4veiW8jc9cNdgIoqn3hAKS?si=8c5a9c253c96417f). I've also been playing more chess, if you'd like to verse me on Lichess my username is [Tomazius](https://lichess.org/@/tomazius). I'll probably be in Turkey for another week or so, and heading to South Korea next. Güle güle!
