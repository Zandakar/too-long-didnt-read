Istanbul is exactly the kind of place that I wanted to visit when I set out. Culturally it's extremely different from Europe and much of the western world, from the middle-eastern aesthetics of the buildings to the food and religious practices.

One of the first thing you notice is the amount of stray cats everywhere, and I mean everywhere. In the subway, in the restaurants, and especially out in the streets. Aptly nicknamed the city of cats, they were originally introduced to keep the rats away from the primarily wooden homes, but have since become a part of everyday Turkish life.

The government runs a program that waters, feeds and immunises the cats (and dogs). This, mixed with the people's adoration for them, means that the average stray looks extremely healthy and is very comfortable around people.

Another thing that stands out are the daily calls to prayers. Muslims pray 5 times a day starting at sunrise, and when it's time to pray it's clearly announced from the rooftops of the many mosques around the city over loudspeaker by the muezzins (Islamic officials) though song. Admittedly, 5 am is a bit earlier than I'd like.

Since it's forbidden to show the faces of religious prophets, mosques put emphasis on colours, shapes, and text. Blue is often used, so much that when the visited Turkey they named blue "turquoise" - colour of the Turks.

Police with machine guns. Restricted internet. Metal detectors in shopping malls
