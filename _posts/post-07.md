You never get to see everything you want in any particular city. I wish I could have stayed in Berlin longer, but I'm also keen on a change of scenery.

Prague has the kind of history that I wanted to see in Europe. Once the capital of the great Bohemia (which took up about 1/3 [edit: 1/5th] of Europe by size), it is now a humble city with a population of 1.3 Million. It holds the crown for most beer consumed by population at 181.7L / person annually. Pilsner Urquell, a local favourite, is the first Pilsner ever created around 1842.

The Czech republic was formed in 1993, when the country now known as Slovakia decided to split from Czechoslovakia. They currently use the Czech Crown (I recommend using a local banks' ATM), although most places accept Euros. While there are many churches and religions statues,the country is now ~80%. The catholic church oppressed the area for many years, and so a strong anti-religious sentiment grew among the population over the years.

It still feels wrong to be able to buy alcohol in the stores and drink on the street. While public drinking is cool, I think that only selling drinks in separate liquor stores is a good thing - If you're trying to quit or pull back your drinking, not being able to get groceries without being bombarded with drinks at the checkouts would test even the strongest of wills eventually.

the city is also littered with Potravinys (corner stores), but also surprisingly weed shops. Weed is illegal, and these stores only sell variants with <1% THC, hence it's simply a tourist trap. Most drugs are decriminalised for possession under 1 gram unlike its Slovakian counterpart, where a small joint can see you serving a prison sentence of up to 8 years.

For the first time in my life I'm actually starting to feel old. Many of the people I'm meeting are early 20's and while there isn't much of a difference character-wise (probably more a reflection of me than them), if I try to keep up with them I get my ass kicked.

I haven't met anyone else that's travelling for longer than 2 months yet. Most of the travellers I come across are European themselves doing weekend trips, or sometimes for as long as a month or two. It's very different to Japan, where I regularly met backpackers staying for up to a year.

The hostel I stayed at in Prague was truly a shithole. Lesson learned - accommodation is more than just a place to sleep, and it's worth spending some extra time and money to find a place that you'll enjoy staying at. Common rooms (or lack thereof) can make or break the vibe. I've found that places with a pool table or similar tend to be way more social.

Currently on my way to Vienna in Austria where I'll spend 4 days, and then the same in Bratislava, Slovakia. Unsure where I'll go next, but that's part of the fun. I might slow down the frequency at which I write my blog to once every 1.5 - 2 weeks. I've been procrastinating adding a mailing list to this blog, once I finish the song I'm currently working on I'll do that too.
\
\
Ahoj, till next time.
