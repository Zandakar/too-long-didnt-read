The Netherlands and Germany are comparatively pretty expensive countries. Going towards the Czech Republic / Hungary means I can finally afford my own room in hostels. No more snoring! There's something pretty cool about staying in dorms, especially if you get a good room, but I'm looking forward to consistently having my own space.

You never get to see everything you want in any particular city. I'm sad about leaving Berlin, but keen on a change of scenery.

For the first time in my life I'm actually starting to feel old. Many of the people I'm meeting are early 20's and while there isn't much of a difference character-wise (maybe that's a reflection on me?), if I try to keep up with them I get my ass kicked. I got a pretty bad chest infection last week and spent another few days in bed. Didn't want to bitch and moan about being sick every week, but also think it's important to log things as truthfully as possible. I stayed up drinking till 4 am for a week straight after getting Covid, so I think this one's on me.

Brands are meaningless when you travel. Which supermarket has what I need?

I've been getting into music production and finally made something I like. If you like techno music, give it a listen. My current goal is to try and get something published on Spotify which has to happen through a 3rd party publisher. I'd like to experiment with a few different genres and see what I can come up with.

I've been procrastinating adding a mailing list to this blog
