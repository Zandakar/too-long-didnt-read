You never get to see everything you want in any particular city. I wish I could have stayed in Berlin longer, but I'm also keen on a change of scenery.
\
\
Prague has the kind of history that I wanted to see in Europe. Once the capital of the great Bohemia (which took up about 1/3 of Europe by size), it is now a humble city with a population of 1.3 Million. It holds the crown for most beer consumed by population at 181.7L / person annually. Pilsner Urquell, a local favourite, is the first Pilsner ever created around 1842.
\
\
The Czech republic was formed in 1993, when the country now known as Slovakia decided to split from Czechoslovakia. They currently use the Czech Crown (I recommend using a local banks' ATM), although most places accept Euros. While there are many churches and religions statues,the country is now ~80%. The catholic church oppressed the area for many years, and so a strong anti-religious sentiment grew among the population over the years.
\
\
It still feels wrong to be able to buy alcohol in the stores and drink on the street. While public drinking is cool, I think that only selling drinks in separate liquor stores is a good thing - If you're trying to quit or pull back your drinking, not being able to get groceries without being bombarded with drinks at the checkouts would test even the strongest of wills eventually.
\
\
the city is also littered with Potravinys (corner stores), but also surprisingly weed shops. Weed is illegal, and these stores only sell variants with <1% THC, hence it's simply a tourist trap. Most drugs are decriminalised for possession under 1 gram unlike its Slovakian counterpart, where a small joint can see you serving a prison sentence of up to 8 years.
\
\
For the first time in my life I'm actually starting to feel old. Many of the people I'm meeting are early 20's and while there isn't much of a difference character-wise (I think that one's on me), if I try to keep up with them I get my ass kicked.
\
\
I haven't met anyone else that's travelling for longer than 2 months yet. Most of the travellers I come across are European themselves doing weekend trips, or sometimes for as long as a month or two. It's very different to Japan, where I regularly met backpackers staying for up to a year.
\
\
The hostel I stayed at in Prague was truly a shithole. Lesson learned - accommodation is more than just a place to sleep, and it's worth spending some extra time and money to find a place that you'll enjoy staying at. Common rooms (or lack thereof) can make or break the vibe. I've found that places with a pool table or similar tend to be way more social.

Currently on my way to Vienna in Austria where I'll spend 4 days, and then the same in Bratislava, Slovakia. Unsure where I'll go next, but that's part of the fun. I might slow down the frequency at which I write my blog to once every 1.5 - 2 weeks. I've been procrastinating adding a mailing list to this blog, once I finish the song I'm currently working on I'll do that too.

Ahoj, till next time.
