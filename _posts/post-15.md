Vietnam cities are an attack on the senses. Crossing the street is an acquired skill that at first feels like certain suicide as you walk into the swarm of buzzing mopeds, however this quickly becomes second nature. Loud techno music soundtracks the tourist hotspots, and the local salespeople can be very persistent in persuading you to buy their wares. I found all of this to be a bit overwhelming.

The Vietnamese countryside is a different story. While some of the above still persists, it's but a backdrop to the beautiful scenery and great food that can be found. Vietnam consistently has the best coffee out of any country I've visited, introduced by the French during their colonial occupation of the country. The famous egg coffee was created by the working class, with the egg whites substituting for the then expensive milk used in cappuccinos. 

Regardless of the wars and occupation, Vietnamese people are extremely accepting of French and American tourists and culture. Having visited both South Korea and Vietnam, it's interesting to see how similar circumstances (The communist North ambushing the Democratic South) resulted in different outcomes, and how that's effected each country.
