I've put off writing this for far too long, but I figured I'd finally finish this off, it would be a shame to leave it unfinished. I'll post what I wrote before returning about Vietnam, and then some general afterthoughts about my travels.

Vietnam cities are an attack on the senses. Crossing the street is an acquired skill that at first feels like certain suicide as you walk into the swarm of buzzing mopeds, however this quickly becomes second nature. Loud techno music soundtracks the tourist hotspots, and the local salespeople can be very persistent in persuading you to buy their wares. I found all of this to be a bit overwhelming.

The Vietnamese countryside is a different story. While some of the above still persists, it's but a backdrop to the beautiful scenery and great food that can be found. Vietnam consistently has the best coffee out of any country I've visited, introduced by the French during their colonial occupation of the country. The famous egg coffee was created by the working class, with the egg whites substituting for the then expensive milk used in cappuccinos.

Regardless of the wars and occupation, Vietnamese people are extremely accepting of French and American tourists and culture. Having visited both South Korea and Vietnam, it's interesting to see how similar circumstances (The communist North ambushing the Democratic South) resulted in different outcomes, and how that's effected each country.

I'd highly recommend the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Mihn, it's a very real, very eye-opening experience. While I didn't get to do it, everyone that's been through the Ha Giang loop only had good things to say about it. The street food is generally tasty, although the little plastic chairs that are common to sit on can take some time to get used to.

All up, I travelled to 10 different counties over the course of 5 months, and I can honestly say that it's been one of the best things I've ever done. Not all of it was easy - I've never been sick as often and as intensely in my life, and I was definitely burned out by the time I hit Vietnam, but it was all made worthwhile by the people I've met and the experiences I've had.

If anything, it's really put things into perspective. Perth truly is a great place to work and live, and work isn't all there is to life. Some of the things I enjoyed the most were reading, local food, and exploring new places with likeminded people. If I was to do it all again (and to some extent I'm sure I will), I would spend more time in less populated places, and I'd have done this sooner in life.

Hostels are awesome and staying in dorms is a sure way to make friends and end up in situations you'd never image yourself in when you jumped out of bed that morning. If I learned anything, it's slow down your life, read more, and spend some of your free time getting good at things you think are cool, that's what's important.

One of the things I wanted to achieve while travelling was to be more creative, and writing this blog was a big part of that. I really enjoyed getting feedback about my posts as I was travelling, so thank you all for taking the time to read this. I can't say I miss the snoring, sharing bathrooms, and saying goodbye to friends on a weekly basis, but I'd do it all again in a heartbeat, and I hope that I've encouraged others to do the same. I'm glad to be back home, and I'm looking forward to being able to finally settle down and commit to things now that this is over.

To all the friends that I've met along the way, take care of yourselves. I hope we meet again, and if you're ever up my way of the woods reach out, you'll always have a couch to sleep on. All the best, Tom.
